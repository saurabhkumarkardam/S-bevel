# indy-key-mgmt

This chart is a component of Hyperledger Bevel. The indy-key-mgmt chart generates the various keys needed for a Hyperledger Indy node. If enabled, the keys are then stored on the configured vault and stored as Kubernetes secrets. See [Bevel documentation](https://hyperledger-bevel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for details.

## TL;DR

```bash
helm repo add bevel https://hyperledger.github.io/bevel
helm install authority-keys bevel/indy-key-mgmt
```

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.19+
- Helm 3.2.0+

If Hashicorp Vault is used, then
- HashiCorp Vault Server 1.13.1+

> **Important**: Also check the dependent charts.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `authority-keys`:

```bash
helm repo add bevel https://hyperledger.github.io/bevel
helm install authority-keys bevel/indy-key-mgmt
```

The command deploys the chart on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `authority-keys` deployment:

```bash
helm uninstall authority-keys
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
